creep deliver energy mechanism
creep requests energy when at 50%
later if that request becomes a job for a distributor the requesting creep knows that energy is on the way and it will sit and wait
if the requesting creep energy gets to zero and no energy is on the way it will look for energy on its own

no creeps can pull energy from spawn or energy piles to deliver to another creep when spawn energy is < threshold
